# Gaze-Detection-Communication-System

This repo contains the files to my Gaze Detection Communication System, the aim of this project was to prototype a gaze tracking software 
that outputs a phrase based on where on a screen the user is looking. The device will use a camera to track the eye-movement of the user, 
and the GUI will have multiple commonly used statements that the user can choose from. 

The software works following the flowchart that is seen below.
