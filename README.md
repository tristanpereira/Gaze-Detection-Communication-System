# Gaze-Detection-Communication-System

This repo contains the files to my Gaze Detection Communication System, the aim of this project was to prototype a gaze tracking software 
that outputs a phrase based on where on a screen the user is looking. The device will use a camera to track the eye-movement of the user, 
and the GUI will have multiple commonly used statements that the user can choose from. 

The software works following the flowchart that is seen below.

The aim for this project was to create a basic communication system that is also portable, so the components needed to replicate this 
project are:
- Raspberry Pi 3 (or newer)
- Camera Module 
- Speaker Module (3.5mm Audio Jack)
- 5V 3A Power Supply 
- Enclosure to house components.
